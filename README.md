# libRocket-Urho3D

A derivitive of [Mike's libRocket-Urho3D port](https://github.com/realrunner/urho3d-librocket).

This is incomplete. A sample is included via the HelloWorld class.

There are currently some limitations:
- Can only create one 3D document at a time
- No input support
- Some texture wrapping issues with 3D documents

This will be improved as time goes on
